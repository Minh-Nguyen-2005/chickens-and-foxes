Three chickens and three foxes come to the bank of a river (honestly as many chickens and foxes as you want). They would like to cross to the other side of the river. However, there is one boat. The boat can carry up to two animals at one time, but doesn't row itself -- at least one animal must be in the boat for the boat to move. If at any time there are more foxes than chickens on either side of the river, then those chickens get eaten. 

I implemented OOP-styled algorithms that will make plans to get everyone across the river in time for lunch, without any chickens becoming lunch, check my report describing my implementation and results.
